        <h2><span class="text-primary">History of</span> Our Hotel</h2>
        <p>
          The origins of Sheraton Hotels date to 1933, when Harvard classmates
          Ernest Henderson and Robert Moore purchased the Continental Hotel in
          Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1937, Henderson and Moore purchased the
          Standard Investing Corporation and the International Equities
          Corporation, combining them into the Standard Equities Corporation,[4]
          the company through which they would run their hotels. Also in 1937,
          they purchased their second hotel, and the first as part of the new
          company, the Stonehaven Hotel in Springfield, Massachusetts, a
          converted apartment building. Sheraton dates its founding to that year
          and considers that property its first hotel.[5] The chain got its name
          from the third hotel the pair acquired, in Boston, in 1939.[6] It had
          a large lighted sign on the roof saying "Sheraton Hotel," which was
          too expensive to change. Instead, Henderson and Moore decided to call
          all of their hotels by that name.[7]
